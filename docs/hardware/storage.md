# Storage systems
## SSD vs HDD
| SSD  | HDD   |
| ---- | ----- |
| Solid State Drive | Hard Disk Drive |
| SSDs use flash memory chips to store data. They have no moving parts, which makes them faster, quieter, and more durable than HDDs. | HDDs use spinning magnetic disks and read/write heads to store and retrieve data. They have moving parts, which makes them slower and more prone to mechanical failure compared to SSDs.|
| faster read and write speeds | slower read and write speeds |
| SSDs are more durable than HDDs because they have no moving parts. | HDDs are less durable due to their mechanical components. |
| more expensive per gigabyte, lower storage capacities | less expensive per gigabyte, higher storage capacities at a lower cost |

SSDs provide better performance, durability, and energy efficiency compared to HDDs, but they are generally more expensive per gigabyte. Many laptops, desktops now come equipped with SSDs or offer SSDs as an option due to their faster boot times, quicker application loading, and overall improved system responsiveness.

HDDs, on the other hand, offer higher storage capacities at a lower cost but are slower and less durable, making them suitable for storing large amounts of data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives.

## SD card
SD (secure digital) cards are small, portable memory cards commonly used in devices such as cameras, smartphones, tablets, and other portable electronics. SD cards typically have slower read and write speeds compared to SSDs.
