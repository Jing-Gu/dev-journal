# Runtime and runtime environment
## Runtime
Runtime refers to the execution period of a program. It encompasses the entire duration of the program from the start to the termination. This includes the execution of the code and any interactions with the operating system, hardware, and other software components.

## Runtime environment
A runtime environment (RTE for short) is the set of hardware and software resources that provides the infrastructure for executing a program or application during its runtime. It acts as a small operating system and provides various basic functions for memory, networks, and hardware, i.e. reading and writing files, managing input and output devices, searching and sorting files, and transporting data via networks. The runtime environment abstracts away the low-level details of the underlying hardware and provides a standardized interface for the program to interact with the system.

There are specific runtime environments associated with many programming languages. For example:
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) that includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run Java applications
- Node.js that includes the V8 JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript on the server side
- .NET Framework to run .NET apps
