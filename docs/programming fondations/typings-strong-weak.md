# Strong vs weak typing

## Strong typing

Strongly typed languages enforce stricter rules on type safety, to ensure operations are performed only on compatible data types.

Static typing doesn't always go with strong typing

Both C++ and Java are statically typed and strongly typed, providing a high degree of type safety.

Python is strongly typed too, even though it is dynamically typed.

## Weak typing

Weakly typed languages allow **type coercion** (the ability for a value to change type implicitly), such as “3” + 5 will raise a type error in a strongly typed language, but won't throw an error in JavaScript (result 35) - a weak typing language.
